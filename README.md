# UrbanPulse: AI City Planning Digital Twin

**Team:** C3G8 - CodingKawKaw0299
**Track:** Challenge 3 - Good Health and Well
**Languange used:** Python

## Project Overview
UrbanPulse is a preventative city planning tool that allows government officials to simulate infrastructure changes (Bike Lanes, Parks, Flyovers) and instantly visualize their impact on **Public Health ROI** and **Community Stress**, powered by the model.

## Problem Statement
Modern city planning operates in silos — traffic departments measure flow, health agencies track asthma cases, and environment teams monitor heat islands. These systems rarely speak to each other. As a result, cities react **after** damage is done.

Infrastructure mistakes are **irreversible**: a flyover that worsens asthma, a development that creates a heat island, or a road project that increases community stress. The fear of making these costly, permanent errors leads to planning paralysis and slow decision-making.

UrbanPulse addresses this by providing a unified way to **see cross-domain consequences before construction**, preventing million-ringgit mistakes and enabling truly resilient cities.

## Solution Summary
UrbanPulse unifies traffic, weather, and health data into a **3D Digital Twin** powered by **SEA-LION AI**. It simulates infrastructure impacts in real time, revealing **Community Stress** and **Health ROI** before construction—giving planners a **zero-risk sandbox** to avoid costly mistakes.
